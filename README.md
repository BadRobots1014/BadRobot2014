This is FRC Team 1014 (The Dublin, Ohio Bad Robots) Robot Source code. 

To use this code, first install the FRC plugin for Eclipse or Netbeans. Then create a new project based off of the Command Based Robot template. Initialize a git repo in the directory of the project, commit it, and pull from the remote.
